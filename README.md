:star: The Game Jam is a programming challenge for children grades 7-12. It is sponsored by SLHS FTC 7729 <C://>HAWKS. The event encourages java programming at a basic level.

This game jam is a competition between teams comprised of 2-3 children. Typically, these small teams come from larger teams.

:star: Teams may come from all over. Feeder schools for Langston Hughes MD, South Lakes HS, Reston and Herndon HS, Herndon make up the bulk of attendees. Other teams outside of that area may participate, however, they need to attend the kick-off and final day of the competition in person.

:writing_hand: The competition has a *kick-off meeting* (TOMORROW!) where the theme and rules for the competition are reviewed. This time is also used to help finalize the teams that collaborate through the game jam. The final day of the competition is where all of the teams work in close quarters with one another. This is how the teams are able to demonstrate coopertition and Gracious Professionalism for the judges.

:nerd_face: By the ends of the competition, the children have an understanding of what it takes to make a video game, computer program, how to manage that creation process, and show off a variety of skills:
